Files in this folder are imported in the following way:

from myuni.util import [file]

or...

from myuni.util import *

For this reason, if you place anything in here that does something (likes wipes
the database for example), then place it ALL in a function, and put the following
at the bottom of the file:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    <call_function>

This way, if someone imports your file by accident (i.e. with import *), your
code won't run and wipe the DB.
